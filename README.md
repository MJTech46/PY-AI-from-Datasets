# PY-AI-from-Datasets

Welcome to **PY-AI-from-Datasets** ðŸŽ¯  
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey of building AI models from datasets using **Python**.  
Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on understanding and implementing the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal
- Learn the fundamentals of **AI and ML workflows** in Python.
- Practice working with **datasets** (loading, cleaning, training, testing).
- Build and understand a **KNN model** from scratch and with libraries.
- Document progress for future reference.

---

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered
- Understanding datasets
- Data preprocessing
- Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
- Implementing **KNN from scratch**
- Using **scikit-learnâ€™s KNN**
- Evaluating model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress
- [x] Setup repo  
- [ ] Add dataset  
- [ ] Implement KNN from scratch  
- [ ] Compare with scikit-learn  
- [ ] Experiment with different datasets  
- [ ] Document findings
